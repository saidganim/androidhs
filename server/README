This directory gives you all the necessary tools you need for the last week of glitch.

You should start by running setup_venv.sh to setup the virtual environment for the python webserver.
Afterwards you can run the web server by running the ./flask.sh. 

## Remote firefox debugging

To perform remote firefox debugging you need to tunnel the firefox debug interface over ssh. 

That is: 

DEBUG_PORT=13370 && ssh -L $DEBUG_PORT:127.0.0.1:$DEBUG_PORT das4
... reserve node
DEBUG_PORT=13370 && ssh -L $DEBUG_PORT:127.0.0.1:$DEBUG_PORT node00x

Then move into the glitch_server directory

source bin/activate
./setup_ff.sh

After you run setup_ff.sh the phone should be in shape to run your code. Then you can simply open the Firefox WebIDE (shift+F8) and connenct to the remote routine at localhost:$DEBUG_PORT
